# Photo Name Changer
Electron based application for changing the names of JPEG/JPG pictures with Timestamp based name from CreationDate

## Use
In order to use the application you need the following tools:
- Node.js
- CMD Tools (I use VS Code)

Clone the repository locally and open CMD or VS Code. Navigate to the project.
Install the dependencies with `npm install`

Test the application with
`npm run start`

Then create an executable for your PC with `npm run make`. This will create the folder **out** in your project.
Copy the folder **namechanger-win32-x64** to your preferred location and create a shortcut to the **namechanger.exe** in order to use it freely.

Easy right ;)
